# Block/Unblock Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the block/unblock functionality across the chat system in the Global Connect Mobile app.

## Files Modified

### 1. `lib/Provider/ChatProvider.dart`
**Key Changes:**
- Added `ChatState.blocked` enum state
- Added `_isBlocked` and `_blockReason` properties
- Added `_checkBlockStatus()` method to check mutual blocking
- Added `_checkIfUserBlockedBy()` method to check if user is blocked by another
- Modified `initializeChatroom()` to check block status before proceeding
- Modified `sendMessage()` to prevent sending when blocked
- Added `refreshBlockStatus()` method for reactive updates
- Updated `reset()` method to include block-related fields

**New Methods:**
```dart
Future<bool> _checkBlockStatus(String receiverId)
Future<bool> _checkIfUserBlockedBy(String userToCheck, String blockedByUserId)
Future<void> refreshBlockStatus()
```

### 2. `lib/View/chat/chat-Screen.dart`
**Key Changes:**
- Added `_buildBlockedWidget()` method to display blocked state UI
- Modified `_buildMessageInput()` to disable input when blocked
- Updated main build method to handle `ChatState.blocked`
- Added `WidgetsBindingObserver` to refresh block status on app resume
- Added block status refresh when returning from settings screen

**New UI Features:**
- Disabled message input with visual feedback when blocked
- Blocked state message with clear explanation
- Previous messages remain visible but new messaging is disabled

### 3. `lib/Provider/privateChatSettingProvider.dart`
**Key Changes:**
- Added `isBlockedByOther` and `blockStatusMessage` properties
- Added `_checkIfUserBlockedBy()` method for mutual blocking check
- Enhanced `checkBlockStatus()` to check both directions
- Updated `reset()` method to include new fields
- Added FirebaseFirestore import

**New Methods:**
```dart
Future<bool> _checkIfUserBlockedBy(String userToCheck, String blockedByUserId)
```

### 4. `lib/View/chat/privateChatSettingScreen.dart`
**Key Changes:**
- Enhanced UI to show mutual blocking status
- Added status message containers with appropriate styling
- Disabled block button when user is blocked by the other person
- Added visual feedback for different blocking scenarios

## Firestore Structure
```javascript
// users collection
{
  uid: "user_id",
  blocked_users: ["blocked_user_id_1", "blocked_user_id_2"]
}
```

## Blocking Logic

### Mutual Blocking Check
The system checks for blocking in both directions:
1. **Current User → Receiver**: `currentUser.blocked_users.contains(receiverId)`
2. **Receiver → Current User**: `receiver.blocked_users.contains(currentUserId)`

### Blocking Scenarios
1. **User A blocks User B**: User B cannot send messages to User A
2. **User B blocks User A**: User A cannot send messages to User B
3. **Both users block each other**: Neither can send messages to the other

### UI Behavior
- **Blocked State**: Shows "Messaging Disabled" message with reason
- **Input Field**: Disabled with grayed-out appearance
- **Send Button**: Disabled with reduced opacity
- **Previous Messages**: Remain visible for context

## Reactive Updates
- Block status is checked when:
  - Chat screen is initialized
  - User attempts to send a message
  - App is resumed from background
  - User returns from settings screen
  - Block/unblock action is performed

## Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if Firestore queries fail
- Clear error messages for users
- Loading states during block operations
- Network error handling

## Security Considerations
- Server-side validation should be implemented
- Block status should be verified on the backend before message delivery
- Rate limiting for block/unblock operations

## Future Enhancements
1. **Real-time Block Status**: Use Firestore listeners for instant updates
2. **Block History**: Track when users were blocked/unblocked
3. **Block Notifications**: Notify users when they're blocked/unblocked
4. **Group Chat Blocking**: Extend blocking to group chats
5. **Block Analytics**: Track blocking patterns for moderation

## Testing Scenarios
1. User A blocks User B → Verify User B cannot send messages
2. User B blocks User A → Verify User A cannot send messages
3. Both users block each other → Verify neither can send messages
4. User A unblocks User B → Verify messaging is restored
5. Block status persistence across app restarts
6. Block status updates in real-time
7. Error handling during network issues
8. UI state management during block operations
